"Note: The regional average sulphur dioxide indicator is based on the concentrations recorded at 5 monitoring stations in Atlantic Canada, 7 in southern Quebec, 7 in southern Ontario, 24 in the Prairies and northern Ontario region, and 21 in British Columbia. The Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standard is provided for illustrative purposes only and not for assessing the achievement status of the standards. Reporting of the achievement of the standards is done within specific jurisdictions using 3-year averages. For more information on the indicators, consult the Air quality indicators definitions in the Methods section (www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/air-quality.html#def).",,,,,
